# Node-RED Workshop
Welcome to the NodeRED Workshop 


## Setting Up
Claim one of the printed sheets from the tables containing the URL, username and password for a node red instance hosted on our shared server (one per person). When you log in you will be presented with the NodeRED Editor - this is for you to use during this workshop.

The first thing you need to do is to setup your Nexmo Credentials, you should have a note of your API Key and Secret to hand or you can find these on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).

Nexmo uses different authentication for our various APIs. For this workshop we will first set up Basic Auth which is used for SMS and Verify, We will get you going with sending your first SMS,

We will then move on to  create a Nexmo Voice application which will provide the auth for the Voice API.
