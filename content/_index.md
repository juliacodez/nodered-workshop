# Node-RED Workshop
Welcome to the NodeRED Workshop! 


## Getting Started with Node-RED

> Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.  
It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

For this workshop, we'll be using a desktop version of Node-RED called [Workbench](https://github.com/sammachin/workbench/releases).  Download the latest version at [https://github.com/sammachin/workbench/releases](https://github.com/sammachin/workbench/releases) and install it on your machine.

When you first open up the application, you'll be prompted to log in. Use the default credentials `admin`/`password` to do so, then set your own under **Settings**.

Select _Workbench -> Settings_ from the top menu bar, set your new _Username_ and _Password_, then hit *Save*. You'll be using these credentials going forward.

Alternatively, youâ€™ll need to install the Node-RED runtime and editor. This could be done either on your local machine, on a Single Board Computer (eg Raspberry Pi), or a number of cloud-hosted options. If you prefer to go this route, follow the getting started instructions on [nodered.org](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/).   
This is where you'll also find the [documentation](https://nodered.org/docs/), [example flows](https://flows.nodered.org/) and more.

## ngrok

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/product) is a tunneling service that we've decided to build into Workbench. It exposes your local server to the internet over secure tunnelsâ€”it allows the Vonage APIs to communicate with your application.  

It works out of the box, navigate to _ngrok_ in the top menu bar to start, stop and inspect your tunnel. (1)  
Once your tunnel is running, you can copy the URL to Clipboard by clicking on it---this will come in handy later on when working with webhooks. (2)

This tunnel will stay open for 8 hours without an ngrok account, after that you'll have to restart it, and you'll get a different randomly generated URL.  

To avoid this, sign up for an [ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup), then fill in your credentials in the _ngrok_ section of the _Workbench Settings_ page.

 Even though it will still be randomly generated, a free account will make your URL persist.
